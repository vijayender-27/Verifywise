# Clean Architecture Implementation

This project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, a software design pattern that separates the application's business logic from its infrastructure and presentation layers. This approach aims to make the code more maintainable, scalable, and easier to test.

## Layer Structure

The project is divided into three main layers:

### Presentation (UI)

This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying the application's user interface (UI). It includes components, views, and controllers that manage the user interface. The presentation layer communicates with the application layer to perform actions and retrieve data.

### Application (Business Logic)

The application layer contains the business logic of the application. It defines the use cases, interfaces, and entities that are used throughout the application. This layer is responsible for orchestrating the flow of data between the presentation and infrastructure layers.

### Infrastructure (Node.js Server and API)

The infrastructure layer is responsible for connecting the application to external services, such as databases, file systems, networks, and third-party APIs. It includes the implementation details of how the application interacts with the outside world.

## Benefits of Clean Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility, making it easier to maintain and update the application without affecting other layers.
2. **Testability**: The application layer can be tested independently of the presentation and infrastructure layers, ensuring that the business logic is correct and decoupled from the UI and external dependencies.
3. **Flexibility**: The Clean Architecture pattern allows for easy substitution of layers without affecting the rest of the application (e.g., switching from a Node.js server to a different technology stack).
4. **Scalability**: The separation of layers enables the application to scale more efficiently, as each layer can be optimized and scaled independently.

## Implementation Details

- The presentation layer is implemented using React and TypeScript, with Vite as the build tool.
- The application layer is written in TypeScript and defines the business logic of the application.
- The infrastructure layer is built using Node.js and connects to external services and APIs.

## Development Guidelines

- Each layer should be developed and tested independently to ensure that the application's business logic is decoupled from the UI and infrastructure.
- Use interfaces and abstractions to define the interactions between layers, ensuring that the application is modular and easy to maintain.
- Follow the SOLID principles of object-oriented design to ensure that the code is flexible, maintainable, and scalable.

By following the principles of Clean Architecture, this project aims to create a maintainable, scalable, and efficient application that is easy to understand and extend.
