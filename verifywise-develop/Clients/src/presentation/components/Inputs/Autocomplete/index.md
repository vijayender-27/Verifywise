# AutoCompleteField Component

The AutoCompleteField component is designed to provide an autocomplete input field with a dropdown list of options. It is highly customizable and can be used in various scenarios where user input needs to be validated against a predefined list of options.

## Properties

- `id`: The unique identifier for the autocomplete field.
- `type`: The type of the input field.
- `options`: The list of options for the autocomplete.
- `placeholder`: The placeholder text for the input field.
- `disabled`: Whether the autocomplete field is disabled.
- `sx`: The style properties for the autocomplete field.
- `width`: The width of the input field.
- `autoCompleteValue`: The current value of the autocomplete field.
- `setAutoCompleteValue`: The function to set the value of the autocomplete field.
- `error`: The error message to display.

## Usage

To use the AutoCompleteField component, simply import it and pass the required properties as needed. Here's an example:

```jsx
import AutoCompleteField from "./AutoCompleteField";

const App = () => {
  const [autoCompleteValue, setAutoCompleteValue] = useState(undefined);

  return (
    <AutoCompleteField
      id="example-autocomplete"
      type="text"
      options={optionsList}
      placeholder="Select an option"
      disabled={false}
      sx={{ width: 300 }}
      autoCompleteValue={autoCompleteValue}
      setAutoCompleteValue={setAutoCompleteValue}
      error={error}
    />
  );
};
```

This will render an AutoCompleteField component with the specified properties, allowing users to select an option from the dropdown list and handling the selection accordingly.
