# Dropdowns Component

The Dropdowns component is designed to provide a customizable dropdown input field. It utilizes Material-UI's Select component to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.

## Properties

- `elementId`: The unique identifier for the dropdown input.
- `state`: The current state of the dropdown input.
- `setState`: The function to call when the dropdown state changes.

## Usage

To use the Dropdowns component, simply import it and pass the required properties as needed. Here's an example:

```jsx
import Dropdowns from "./Dropdowns";

const App = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);

  return (
    <Dropdowns
      elementId="example-dropdown"
      state={state}
      setState={(newState) => setState(newState)}
    />
  );
};
```

This will render a Dropdowns component with the specified properties, allowing users to select an option and handling the state change accordingly.

## Customization

The Dropdowns component allows for customization through the `elementId`, `state`, and `setState` properties. You can pass any valid values to these properties to change the behavior and appearance of the component.

## Features
