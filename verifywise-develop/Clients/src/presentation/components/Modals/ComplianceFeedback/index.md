# ComplianceFeedback Component

The ComplianceFeedback component is designed to provide a rich text editor for users to provide feedback or evidence. It also allows users to upload files as evidence.

## Props

- `activeSection`: A string indicating the active section, either "Evidence" or "Feedback".
- `feedback`: The initial feedback or evidence content.
- `onChange`: A function to be called when the feedback or evidence content changes.

## Example Usage

```jsx
import ComplianceFeedback from "./ComplianceFeedback";

const App = () => {
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState("");

  const handleFeedbackChange = (e) => {
    setFeedback(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <ComplianceFeedback
      activeSection="Feedback"
      feedback={feedback}
      onChange={handleFeedbackChange}
    />
  );
};
```

## Styling

The ComplianceFeedback component uses Material-UI's theme to style the rich text editor and the file upload feature. The styling includes:

- A rich text editor with a specific width, height, and padding.
- A file upload feature with a specific border, color, and cursor style.

## Customization

The ComplianceFeedback component can be customized by passing a custom theme to the Material-UI provider. This allows for a high degree of flexibility in terms of styling and branding.

## Accessibility

The ComplianceFeedback component is designed to be accessible and follows Material-UI's guidelines for accessibility. It includes attributes such as `aria-label` and `role` to ensure that the rich text editor and the file upload feature are accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Future Development

Future development plans for the ComplianceFeedback component include:

- Adding support for different file types in the file upload feature.
- Enhancing the component's accessibility features.
