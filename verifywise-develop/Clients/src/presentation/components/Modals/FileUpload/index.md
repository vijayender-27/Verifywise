# FileUploadModal Component

The FileUploadModal component is designed to render a modal dialog for file uploads. It displays a modal when the `open` prop is true, allowing the user to upload files. The component dynamically adjusts its height based on the content of the file upload component.

## Props

- `open`: A boolean indicating whether the modal is open.
- `onClose`: A function to be called when the modal is closed.
- `uploadProps`: The props to be passed to the FileUploadComponent.

## Example Usage

```jsx
import FileUploadModal from "./FileUploadModal";

const App = () => {
  const [isDialogOpen, setDialogOpen] = useState(false);
  const handleClose = () => setDialogOpen(false);

  return (
    <FileUploadModal open={isDialogOpen} onClose={handleClose} uploadProps={/* your upload props here */} />
  );
};
```

## Styling

The FileUploadModal component uses Material-UI's theme to style the modal. The styling includes:

- A custom height adjustment based on the content of the FileUploadComponent.
- A close icon for closing the modal.

## Customization

The FileUploadModal component can be customized by passing a custom theme to the Material-UI provider. This allows for a high degree of flexibility in terms of styling and branding.

## Accessibility

The FileUploadModal component is designed to be accessible and follows Material-UI's guidelines for accessibility. It includes attributes such as `aria-label` and `role` to ensure that the modal is accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Future Development

Future development plans for the FileUploadModal component include:

- Enhancing the component's accessibility features.
- Improving the component's performance and optimization.
