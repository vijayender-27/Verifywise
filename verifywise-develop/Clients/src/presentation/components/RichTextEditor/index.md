# RichTextEditor Component

The RichTextEditor component is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for editing and formatting text. It includes a toolbar with options for bold, italic, bullets, and numbers, as well as a text editor area where users can input and format their text.

      onContentChange={(content) => console.log(content)}
      headerSx={{ backgroundColor: "lightgray" }}
      bodySx={{ padding: "10px" }}
      initialContent="<p>This is the initial content of the editor.</p>"
