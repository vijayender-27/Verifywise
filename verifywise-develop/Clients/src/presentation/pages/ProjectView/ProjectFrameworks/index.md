# ProjectFrameworks Component

## Overview
The ProjectFrameworks component is a React component that provides a framework selection interface with compliance and assessment tracking capabilities. It's designed to help users manage and track different AI frameworks (like EU AI Act and ISO 42001) within a project context.

## Features
- Framework selection tabs (EU AI Act, ISO 42001)
- Add new framework functionality
- Compliance and Assessment tracking tabs
- Modern, clean UI with consistent styling

## Component Structure

### Main Components
- Framework Selection Tabs
- Add Framework Button
- Tracker Tabs (Compliance/Assessment)

### Props
This component doesn't accept any props as it manages its own state internally.

### State Management
- `framework`: Tracks the currently selected framework ('eu-ai-act' | 'iso-42001')
- `tracker`: Tracks the active tracker tab ('compliance' | 'assessment')

## Styling
The component uses Material-UI (MUI) for styling and follows a consistent design system:
- Colors:
  - Primary: #13715B (Green)
  - Background: #F5F6F6 (Light Gray)
  - Border: #BFC9C5
  - Text: #232B3A
- Typography: Inter font family
- Consistent spacing and sizing

## Usage Example
```tsx
import ProjectFrameworks from './ProjectFrameworks';

const YourComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ProjectFrameworks />
  );
};
```
