        answer: "The AI system includes a supervisory framework where human operators continuously monitor and review key decisions. Alerts are triggered for any critical decision-making processes, ensuring that human intervention is available if necessary. Additionally, there are manual review checkpoints to ensure decisions made by the AI are aligned with company policies and ethical standards."
