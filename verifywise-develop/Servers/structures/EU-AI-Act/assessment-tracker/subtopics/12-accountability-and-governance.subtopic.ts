        answer: "Yes, all inputs and outputs of the AI system are logged continuously in real-time. This includes both raw data and processed outputs. We review the logs on a weekly basis, and we also have an automated alert system that flags any irregularities. If any undesired behavior is detected, a response is triggered within 24 hours, and corrective actions are taken to address the issue, including model retraining if necessary."

        answer: "Our organization has developed a comprehensive strategy for decommissioning AI systems, which includes the secure deletion of data residuals in compliance with data protection regulations. Models and algorithms are archived in a secure repository for future reference or possible retraining, ensuring that intellectual property is safeguarded. Additionally, we work with relevant teams to ensure that all interfaces with other systems are properly closed off to prevent any data leakage or unintended consequences during decommissioning. We also conduct post-decommissioning audits to ensure complete removal and security."
