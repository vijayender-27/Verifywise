        answer: "Our AI system processes data through machine learning models that classify input data based on predefined categories, making decisions by analyzing the relationship between various data points. We utilize Explainable AI (XAI) models to ensure that decisions made by the AI can be easily interpreted by end-users. For local explainability, we use methods like LIME to show which features influence the model’s prediction, while for global explainability, we employ SHAP values to explain the overall behavior of the model and how it considers all inputs."
